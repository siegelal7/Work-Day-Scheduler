# Work-Day-Scheduler

Welcome to your workday scheduler! Use this to plan out your day and ensure you are on time and on task.  
The elements below the header are dynamically populated via Jquery, allowing more control over the designating classes based on time, etc. The biggest challenge was setting and retrieving the values to localStorage; discovering the siblings() method was pivotal in setting my object to push to the array. Ultimately, the biggest hint in creating and populating the page with the HTML was the provided CSS file, which had the textarea element hint and the class names assigned.
